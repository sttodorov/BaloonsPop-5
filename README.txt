PLEASE:
 -Write Documentation (*write as you go, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh5lzpOEWRU)
	- update and git-push the TODO list before starting your turn (this is only while we're coding one person at a time)
	- Document changes as you go in the COMMIT MESSAGE
		- first line is like Title or main-change [50 characters MAX!], 
			then _blank_ line, 
			then list of changes (add, move, reformat, etc.) if necessary, as in the example below
				ex:
				-------------------------COMMIT------------------------------------------	
				Refactor Engine to use Command objects

				Refactor Engine to use Command objects instead of strings
				Add Win() method to ConsoleUI
				Build - no Errors
				moved old change logs to _deprecated since now we use the commit messages
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------
